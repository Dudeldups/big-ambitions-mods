# Cadillac Escalade vehicle calibration

The replacement model depicts a standard-wheelbase 2021 Cadillac Escalade.
Its body, drivetrain metadata, and physics calibration follow the fifth-
generation 6.2 L 4WD vehicle. NWH applies its `maxPower` value more directly
than crank-rated output, so runtime wheel-power and brake-torque values are
solver calibrations derived from the recorded acceleration and braking tests.
