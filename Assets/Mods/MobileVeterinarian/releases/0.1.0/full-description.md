[h1]Mobile Veterinarian[/h1]

Call a mobile veterinarian from the in-game phone to treat the rideable animal you are currently mounted on.

[h2]How it works[/h2]

[list]
[*] Mount a supported animal and bring it to a stop
[*] Call Mobile Veterinarian from the normal phone contacts
[*] Review a price calculated from the animal's actual damage percentage
[*] Close the phone and remain mounted while the veterinarian performs the treatment
[*] Pay only after the real vehicle damage state is fully repaired
[/list]

The veterinarian checks both sides of the animal for a safe standing position. A cancelled or failed visit never charges the player.

[h2]Supported animals[/h2]

The rideable cow from MootorVehicle is supported out of the box. MootorVehicle is optional and is not bundled with this mod.

Other rideable-animal mods can register their exact VehicleType, localized animal name and preferred treatment position through the public registry. All service messages insert the name supplied by the animal mod; registrations without a usable name fall back to “your animal.”

[h2]For mod authors[/h2]

[list]
[*] Assembly and external-build dependency setup
[*] Registration and unload cleanup
[*] Localized animal names
[*] Treatment-position coordinates and automatic opposite-side fallback
[*] A focused integration test checklist
[/list]

[h2]Safety and performance[/h2]

The target comes directly from the player's currently controlled vehicle. The mod performs no recurring world scan or permanent per-frame search. Temporary visit monitoring stops immediately on success, failure, cancellation, scene change or unload.

[h2]Compatibility[/h2]

Built for Big Ambitions build 3674.
